                    By right of arms and under the eternal mandate of the Emperor, know this:

                    The Beacon of Nyx and the surrounding forges are henceforth placed under the direct custody of the
                    Dark Angels Chapter. This action is necessitated by corruption and dereliction among the Mechanicus
                    elements entrusted with their charge, whose failures have invited the storms that now imperil the
                    Reach.

                    Civil authority and Mechanicus oversight are suspended. Administratum edicts and lesser writs are
                    annulled until such time as order is restored.

                    The output of the forges remains dedicated to the service of the Imperium. Its distribution will be
                    overseen solely by the Chapter.

                    No petition shall be heard save through the appointed officers of the Chapter. No vessel shall pass
                    into or out of the Beacon without warrant issued under our seal.

                    This proclamation is final. Compliance is obedience; resistance is treachery.
