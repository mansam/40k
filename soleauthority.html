                    By right of arms and under the eternal mandate of the Emperor, know this:

                    The Beacon of Nyx and the surrounding forges are henceforth placed under the direct custody of the
                    Dark Angels Chapter. This action is necessitated by corruption and dereliction among the Mechanicus
                    elements entrusted with their charge, whose failures have invited the storms that now imperil the
                    Reach.

                    Civil authority and Mechanicus oversight are suspended. Administratum edicts and lesser writs are
                    annulled until such time as order is restored.

                    The output of the forges remains dedicated to the service of the Imperium. Its distribution will be
                    overseen solely by the Chapter.

                    No petition shall be heard save through the appointed officers of the Chapter. No vessel shall pass
                    into or out of the Beacon without warrant issued under our seal.

                    This proclamation is final. Compliance is obedience; resistance is treachery.

                    Be advised: the Dark Angels Chapter has declared itself sole authority over the Beacon and
                    surrounding forges, suspending Mechanicus and Administratum rights.

                    These acts are not lawful. They exceed the writ of any Chapter and stand in violation of Edict
                    342/26-NYX.

                    The Raptors Chapter denounces these actions. We affirm our duty to the edict, the forges, and the
                    Throne. We contest the Dark Angels’ claim and will not yield.
