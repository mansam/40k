                <h2>On the Beacon of Nyx</h2>
                <p>
                    Know and tremble: the orb styled Nyxia Prime is by this writ declared sacrosanct.
                    Within its crust abides the Beacon, without which no vessel may traverse, no voice may ascend, no
                    prayer may find its path through the empyrean.
                    This Beacon is not to be reckoned a worldly engine, but the Emperorâ€™s appointed flame, sustained in
                    the silence of night by rites beyond mortal apprehension.
                </p>
                <h2>On the Mechanicum Custodiae</h2>
                <p>
                    Be it further recorded that the forges encircling Nyxia bear the charge of ward and maintenance:
                <ul>
                    <li>Forge Lachesis-IX, which numbers and measures.</li>
                    <li>Forge Clotho-Alpha, which binds and fastens.</li>
                    <li>Forge Atropos-Omega, which sunders and concludes.</li>
                </ul>
                These names are here inscribed, that obedience may be exacted.
                </p>
                <h2>On Subjects and Obligations</h2>

                <p>
                    All planetary governors, autocrats, and councils within this subsector are enjoined:
                <ul>
                    <li>To submit tithe exacted without appeal.</li>
                    <li>To recognize the seal of the Beacon as paramount over all local warrant.</li>
                    <li>To make no hindrance to the labor of the Forges.</li>
                </ul>
                The common subject is enjoined only thus:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To yield obedience when the command is given.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To endure silence when the Beacon is withdrawn.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let it be impressed upon all ranks: dereliction in the matter of Nyxia shall not be endured.
                    Negligence, obstruction, or impiety against the Beacon shall bring the retribution of the Throne, by
                    fire or by silence, until the record of disobedience is erased.
                </p>
